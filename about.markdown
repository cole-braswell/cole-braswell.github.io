Hello there! My name is Cole Braswell! I'm from the suburbs of Chicago. I graduated from Northern Illinois University in 2020, receiving a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science. 

I currently work at a financial company as a software engineer. In my free time I enjoy playing video games such as Halo and Rocket League.
